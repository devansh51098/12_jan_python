The append() method in the programming language Python adds an item to a list that already exists whereas the extend() method adds each of the iterable element which is supplied as a parameter to the end of the original list.Lists in the programming language Python are mutable (The term mutable means that the programmers can update an element in any given list by retrieving it as component of the allocation statement), meaning they can be extended or shortened per the programmer's choice. In other words, programmers can either add or remove elements from specified indices. Append() and extend() are two built-in list functions generally used to add elements, tuples, etc into any given list.
