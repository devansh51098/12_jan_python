Functions are the basic building block of any python program, defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.

A function is used to carry out a specific task. The function might require multiple inputs. When the task is done executing, the function can or can not return one or more values.

There are two types of functions in python:

User-Defined Functions - these types of functions are defined by the user to perform any specific task
Built-in Functions - These are pre-defined functions in python.
