1. Using list.pop() function
The simplest approach is to use the list’s pop([i]) function, which removes an element present at the specified position in the list. If we don’t specify any index, pop() removes and returns the last element in the list.
2. Using Slicing
We know that lists can be sliced in Python. We can use slicing to remove the last element from a list. The idea is to obtain a sublist containing all elements of the list except the last one. Since slice operation returns a new list, we have to assign the new list to the original list. This can be done using the expression l = l[:-1], where l is your list. l[:-1] is short for l[0:len(l)-1].
3. Using del statement
Another way to remove an element from a list using its index is the del statement. It differs from the pop() function as it does not return the removed element. Unlike the slicing function, this doesn’t create a new list.
the removed element would be 25.
